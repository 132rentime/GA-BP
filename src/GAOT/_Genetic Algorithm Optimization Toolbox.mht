<HR>

<P><EM>GAOT</EM> implements simulated evolution in the Matlab =
environment using=20
both binary and real representations. Ordered base representation has =
also been=20
added to the toolbox. This implementation is very flexible in the =
genetic=20
operators, selection functions, termination functions as well as the =
evaluation=20
functions that can be used. The implementation is described in a =
technical=20
paper. The paper can be referenced as follows:=20

<H3>Requirements</H3>The only requirement is that you have Matlab =

later. The toolbox should work without any modifications.=20
<H3>Changes from the Matlab 4 Version</H3>The only change of =
significance is the=20
order of return parameters in the evaluation functions. The evaluation =
function=20
required that the new fitness value and then individual be returned. =
Owing to a=20
change in the order of handling return values by Matlab, the values of =
the=20
indivual are turned and then the new fitness value is returned. This was =
the=20
simplest fix to get the Toolbox to work under Matlab 5. Also,=20
